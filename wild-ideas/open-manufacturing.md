# Open Manufacturing

As a maker/designer/artist type person who designs products for manufacturing, there is a lot of labor lost to packaging parts when starting out on a small scale. Many people may be able to package 200 units which consists of 1-30 parts by hand, but as an ADHD brained person I just can't. I just daydream about automation and it breaks my flow.

So I started working on it and as VDBX grows, I hope to continue documenting my findings. I've found that this is an excellent application for the FLIP\_C3 since we usually have a higher root voltage.



### Active prototypes and other dev work

* An adjustable, multi port USB-C jig with panel ejector system.
* Heavy modifications to commonly available _screw presenters_
* Pin header dispensing or length cutting from bulk
* Bagging and sealing
* Dispensing and sorting
  * guitar picks, allen keys, screws,  boards, etc
* Low cost printing for value-add packaging
