# Dimensions & Specs

Early prototypes were very scattered, so here we rebase the geometry to build it parametrically.

* Switches
  * On center - 18mm
    * Hole dia - 6mm + 0.2mm
* LED Insert
  * X/Y/Z - 50/100/3mm
    * Radius - 20mm
* Cover-plate
  * X/Y/Z - 60/110/3mm
    * Radius - 15mm
  * Screw spacing - 80.551 (fix)
    * Hardware x 2
      * M3 or #6 thread-cutting
      * Hole Dia: 3mm + 0.2mm
* Enclosure
  * Thickness&#x20;
    * 1.2mm - Printed in PETG with a 0.6 nozzle presents excellent results that print super fast (13 mins), but the floppiness of the part could be concerning to people.&#x20;
  * X/Y/Z - 50/100/
    * Small Side Offset -&#x20;
    * Radius - 20mm
    * Holes:
      * 3mm for coverplate - 2
      * Drill marks for wall mounting - 2
        * On center -&#x20;
