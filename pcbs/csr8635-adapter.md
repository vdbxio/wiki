The following is just a replication of the Tindie listing.

Note: There are three main variants of these boards with different pin layouts:

1.  Commonly listed as BTM-835B - this board has pins on all sides and requires an external antenna. It is generally a board with blue solder mask.
2.  Commonly listed as BTM835 - this board generally has it's chip angled at 45Â° and has an equal amount of pins on both of the long sides. This one generally has a blue solder mask.
3.  **Commonly listed as BC8635 -** Usually has green solder mask and the two long sides have 14 and 15 pins respectively.

AliExpress is my go-to for procuring them. Here are links to a couple:

## **Why did you make it?**

I am working on building a Bluetooth audio headset but didn't realize how small the pins on these modules are. For prototyping my device, I wanted to be able to use this board on a breadboard and have a visual reference to the pinouts.

## **What makes it special?**

These Bluetooth audio boards are super cheap and I'd love to see more people able to prototype with them. Look out for my headset project coming in a couple months.
