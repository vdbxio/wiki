# Welcome

## About

VDBX or "Voidbox Industries" is currently focused on designing hardware for use with Home Assistant in off-grid, battery powered setups. Our hardware lineup for 2023 is focused on the FLIP-C3 node platform for creating smart devices on off-grid and battery powered systems. The project takes a priority with integrating into Home Assistant via the ESPHome firmware, but can run anything an ESP32-C3 can.&#x20;

Chloe Madison, resident designer and founder currently lives full time in a converted "shorty" school bus that she's constantly still working on.

## Message from Chloe

Voidbox Industries is yet another one of my brands making sure I don't have to do a bland 9-5 and instead can rely on my art. It's not always worth it, but making art is a compulsion for me and I can't imagine doing anything else (aside from the dopamine rabbit holes). Also I'm autistic.... have fun with that.&#x20;

In 2017, while becoming disillusioned with the tech industry, I decided to dive deeper into a maker hobby most people would have already assumed I had years of experience with. Starting with mold making, concrete pouring and mentally mapping basic material science; all while learning to 3D model and design circuits. I've always been a designer first ... just with a serious interest in doing so with technology. Going down this road opened my eyes to what I was capable of as an artist.

When COVID hit, I was focused on making concrete [knicknacks](concrete/concrete-card-holder.md) and my sales immediately dried up, but a few months later, my unemployment finally went thru and I decided to make some changes. At the time I was living in a van and had a small private art studio in Berkeley amongst a shared artist warehouse. I realized this wasn't tenable long-term and I wanted to consolidate even more so that I wouldn't run into a situation where not being able to pay rent would turn to dire circumstances.&#x20;

I found my bus in July 2020 and immediately started building and also moved in while it was still very much a prototype. Over the next few years, I worked on building it closer and closer to my vision, while I prepped to get back to work as the world decided that COVID doesn't exist anymore. I spent a significant amount of this time dealing with physical and mental health issues, but thankfully do have access to medical care. Unfortunately this means I have to put my concrete work on hold until I have space to make that kind of mess again.

I knew this was necessary when I moved everything into the bus, so I'm not upset by it despite missing it. In 2023 I started refining some of my findings from building my bus and integrating Home Assistant into an off-grid application and released the FLIP\_C3 and the end of that year. In June of 2024 I got the PwrTool 500 pre-launched on Crowd Supply with the official lauch coming around Jan 2025.

I'm starting to become seen by my peers which feels really amazing.&#x20;

I hope to someday have the opportunity to turn Voidbox into a worker co-op that manufactures & retails open hardware for other makers and artists, especially under-represented folks.  It may just be me right now, but I use "we" optimistically throughout these docs.
