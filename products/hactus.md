## Hactus

{% hint style="warning" %}
We currently do not have the resources for concrete production, but still have Hactus PCB sets for sale. You can place them in the ground next to your real plants!!!
{% endhint %}

### Summary

The Hactus is a manufacturable and functional art piece by Chloe Madison (@clomads) that embodies the visual of a cactus succulent using two interlocking PCB 'perfboards.' It also includes a flower pot intended for casting in concrete.
