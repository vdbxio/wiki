description: Major parts and alternatives for the FLIP_C3
---

# BOM (WIP)

The retail version of the FLIP\_C3 is currently manufactured by JLCPCB using their parts library via LCSC. This is a living document of the BOM and potential alternate parts including those used in production or considered for production. This document can be used in case of stock declines or discontinuation of parts. Basic passives like resistors and capacitors may not be included as this is intended for major functional parts and those parts can be easily replaced with a simple search when using the BOM directly from the EasyEDA files.
