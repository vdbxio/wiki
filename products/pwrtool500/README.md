## Overview

A 500 amp smart shunt for DC power systems up to 60v\* ([50v for now](../flip\_c3/)). It is based on our FLIP-C3 mainboard and power center running ESPHome for seamless integration with Home Assistant out of the box.&#x20;

An on board 45w NPN MOSFET can power fans, LED strips, or control external relays based on automations in Home Assistant. Also keep an eye on the ambient temp/humidity of your control box with the onboard sensor and catch potential issues with the on-die temp sensor of the analog-to-digital converter IC.

PwrTool 500 is fully open, this is your hardware and it is fully hackable. Extend it further with ESPHome, Tasmota or your own custom Arduino or ESP-IDF code. The on-board buck converter provides a total power budget of 10w for all of the activities. Make the PwrTool the brains of your power cabinet.
